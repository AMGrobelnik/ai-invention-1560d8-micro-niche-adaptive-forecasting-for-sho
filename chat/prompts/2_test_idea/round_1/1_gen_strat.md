<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  For short synthetic time series, dynamically switching between simple forecasting models (e.g., 3-point moving average,
  naive last-value forecast) based on real-time, instantly computable local 'micro-environmental cues' (such as local trend
  direction or recent volatility) will outperform either model individually, by enabling each model to operate within its
  optimal 'micro-niche' of data characteristics.
motivation: >-
  Traditional forecasting methods, including many adaptive ensembles or regime-switching models, struggle with very short
  time series due to insufficient data for learning complex parameters or stable regime identification. By leveraging an ecological
  'niche partitioning' principle, this hypothesis proposes a lightweight, dynamic selection mechanism for simple models that
  can adapt quickly to local data characteristics, potentially overcoming the limitations of small sample sizes and improving
  predictive performance in data-scarce scenarios.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit discernible 'micro-environmental cues' (e.g., local trend changes, shifts in volatility)
  that are indicative of which simple forecasting model (MA vs. Naive) is momentarily superior.
- >-
  The 'micro-environmental cues' can be reliably and instantly computed from very limited recent data points.
- >-
  The performance difference between simple models is significant enough within their respective 'micro-niches' to warrant
  dynamic switching.
- >-
  The synthetic series has at least two distinct local 'niches' or regimes where one simple model consistently outperforms
  the other.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate various short synthetic time series (e.g., oscillating with varying frequencies/amplitudes, periods of trend/flatness,
  sudden shifts). Implement a 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast. Develop a 'micro-niche adaptation' algorithm
  that continuously calculates simple local cues (e.g., difference between last two points for trend, variance of last three
  for volatility) and uses these to decide whether to use the MA or Naive forecast for the next step. Compare the predictive
  accuracy (e.g., Mean Squared Error) of the micro-niche adaptive approach against the individual MA and Naive forecasts on
  these synthetic series.
success_criteria: >-
  The micro-niche adaptive forecasting approach consistently achieves lower Mean Squared Error (or other relevant error metrics)
  compared to both the standalone 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across a diverse set of short synthetic
  time series designed to exhibit different local 'micro-environmental cues'. Disconfirmation would occur if the adaptive
  approach performs no better, or significantly worse, than the individual simple models.
related_works:
- >-
  Adaptive Ensemble Forecasting: Many adaptive ensemble methods exist, but they typically involve more complex base models
  or learning sophisticated weighting schemes over longer time series. Our hypothesis focuses on a simpler, ecologically-inspired
  dynamic selection among *minimal* forecasting models using *instantly computable local cues* for *very short series*, a
  specific combination not widely explored.
- >-
  Regime-Switching Models: While these models adapt to different data 'regimes', they often require sufficient data to learn
  the parameters of each regime and the switching probabilities. Research (e.g., Elliott, 2004) suggests they struggle with
  small sample sizes. Our 'micro-niche adaptation' circumvents complex parameter learning by reacting to immediate, simple
  local cues, specifically targeting the small data challenge.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by the ecological principle of 'niche partitioning', where different species (here, simple forecasting
  models) coexist and thrive by specializing in distinct 'niches' (specific local data characteristics) within an ecosystem
  (the time series). This conceptual transfer suggests a mechanism for dynamic model selection that is agile and efficient,
  particularly suited for resource-constrained environments like very short time series.
terms:
- term: Micro-Niche Adaptation
  definition: >-
    A dynamic forecasting strategy where simple models are selected on-the-fly based on instantaneous, localized data characteristics
    (micro-environmental cues), allowing each model to operate within its optimal data 'niche'.
- term: Micro-Environmental Cues
  definition: >-
    Simple, instantly computable local statistical properties of a time series (e.g., local trend, recent volatility) that
    serve as indicators for which forecasting model is most appropriate for the immediate next prediction.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes a 'Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting' approach for short time series, dynamically switching between
  simple models like moving average and naive forecasts based on real-time local data cues. Inspired by ecological niche partitioning,
  this method aims to outperform individual simple models by allowing each to specialize in its optimal data 'niche', particularly
  addressing challenges with small sample sizes.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for study design, proper baselines, and the evaluation/validity norms this field demands.

</iteration_status>

<previous_strategies>
No previous strategies exist. This is the FIRST iteration.
</previous_strategies>

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Your previous response had issues that need fixing:

DEPENDENCY ERRORS (depends_on can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>):
  - Strategy 1: artifact 'experiment_iter1_dir2' depends on 'dataset_1' which does not exist in artifact pool
  - Strategy 1: artifact 'evaluation_iter1_dir3' depends on 'experiment_1' which does not exist in artifact pool

Fix ALL issues above and regenerate your strategies:

1. Fix dependency errors:
   - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects — every entry MUST have a non-empty short label
   - id can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>
   - You CANNOT reference artifacts you are proposing in this strategy as dependencies (they all run in parallel)
   - Follow the dependency type rules (e.g., experiments require datasets)
   - If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use depends_on: []
