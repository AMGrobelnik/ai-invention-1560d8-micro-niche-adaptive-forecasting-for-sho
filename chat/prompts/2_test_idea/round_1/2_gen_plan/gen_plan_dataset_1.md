<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  For short synthetic time series, dynamically switching between simple forecasting models (e.g., 3-point moving average,
  naive last-value forecast) based on real-time, instantly computable local 'micro-environmental cues' (such as local trend
  direction or recent volatility) will outperform either model individually, by enabling each model to operate within its
  optimal 'micro-niche' of data characteristics.
motivation: >-
  Traditional forecasting methods, including many adaptive ensembles or regime-switching models, struggle with very short
  time series due to insufficient data for learning complex parameters or stable regime identification. By leveraging an ecological
  'niche partitioning' principle, this hypothesis proposes a lightweight, dynamic selection mechanism for simple models that
  can adapt quickly to local data characteristics, potentially overcoming the limitations of small sample sizes and improving
  predictive performance in data-scarce scenarios.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit discernible 'micro-environmental cues' (e.g., local trend changes, shifts in volatility)
  that are indicative of which simple forecasting model (MA vs. Naive) is momentarily superior.
- >-
  The 'micro-environmental cues' can be reliably and instantly computed from very limited recent data points.
- >-
  The performance difference between simple models is significant enough within their respective 'micro-niches' to warrant
  dynamic switching.
- >-
  The synthetic series has at least two distinct local 'niches' or regimes where one simple model consistently outperforms
  the other.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate various short synthetic time series (e.g., oscillating with varying frequencies/amplitudes, periods of trend/flatness,
  sudden shifts). Implement a 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast. Develop a 'micro-niche adaptation' algorithm
  that continuously calculates simple local cues (e.g., difference between last two points for trend, variance of last three
  for volatility) and uses these to decide whether to use the MA or Naive forecast for the next step. Compare the predictive
  accuracy (e.g., Mean Squared Error) of the micro-niche adaptive approach against the individual MA and Naive forecasts on
  these synthetic series.
success_criteria: >-
  The micro-niche adaptive forecasting approach consistently achieves lower Mean Squared Error (or other relevant error metrics)
  compared to both the standalone 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across a diverse set of short synthetic
  time series designed to exhibit different local 'micro-environmental cues'. Disconfirmation would occur if the adaptive
  approach performs no better, or significantly worse, than the individual simple models.
related_works:
- >-
  Adaptive Ensemble Forecasting: Many adaptive ensemble methods exist, but they typically involve more complex base models
  or learning sophisticated weighting schemes over longer time series. Our hypothesis focuses on a simpler, ecologically-inspired
  dynamic selection among *minimal* forecasting models using *instantly computable local cues* for *very short series*, a
  specific combination not widely explored.
- >-
  Regime-Switching Models: While these models adapt to different data 'regimes', they often require sufficient data to learn
  the parameters of each regime and the switching probabilities. Research (e.g., Elliott, 2004) suggests they struggle with
  small sample sizes. Our 'micro-niche adaptation' circumvents complex parameter learning by reacting to immediate, simple
  local cues, specifically targeting the small data challenge.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by the ecological principle of 'niche partitioning', where different species (here, simple forecasting
  models) coexist and thrive by specializing in distinct 'niches' (specific local data characteristics) within an ecosystem
  (the time series). This conceptual transfer suggests a mechanism for dynamic model selection that is agile and efficient,
  particularly suited for resource-constrained environments like very short time series.
terms:
- term: Micro-Niche Adaptation
  definition: >-
    A dynamic forecasting strategy where simple models are selected on-the-fly based on instantaneous, localized data characteristics
    (micro-environmental cues), allowing each model to operate within its optimal data 'niche'.
- term: Micro-Environmental Cues
  definition: >-
    Simple, instantly computable local statistical properties of a time series (e.g., local trend, recent volatility) that
    serve as indicators for which forecasting model is most appropriate for the immediate next prediction.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes a 'Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting' approach for short time series, dynamically switching between
  simple models like moving average and naive forecasts based on real-time local data cues. Inspired by ecological niche partitioning,
  this method aims to outperform individual simple models by allowing each to specialize in its optimal data 'niche', particularly
  addressing challenges with small sample sizes.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter1_dir1
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Generate a diverse set of short synthetic time series to serve as input for forecasting experiments.
approach: >-
  Programmatically generate multiple synthetic time series (e.g., 10-20 data points each) exhibiting distinct 'micro-environmental
  cues' such as local trends (up/down), flat periods, oscillations, and sudden shifts in value or volatility. The series should
  be short enough to highlight the 'small sample size' challenge. Output in a structured JSON format.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for dataset artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
