Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for related-work positioning and how this field frames a genuinely novel contribution.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  For short synthetic time series, dynamically switching between simple forecasting models (e.g., 3-point moving average,
  naive last-value forecast) based on real-time, instantly computable local 'micro-environmental cues' (such as local trend
  direction or recent volatility) will outperform either model individually, by enabling each model to operate within its
  optimal 'micro-niche' of data characteristics.
motivation: >-
  Traditional forecasting methods, including many adaptive ensembles or regime-switching models, struggle with very short
  time series due to insufficient data for learning complex parameters or stable regime identification. By leveraging an ecological
  'niche partitioning' principle, this hypothesis proposes a lightweight, dynamic selection mechanism for simple models that
  can adapt quickly to local data characteristics, potentially overcoming the limitations of small sample sizes and improving
  predictive performance in data-scarce scenarios.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit discernible 'micro-environmental cues' (e.g., local trend changes, shifts in volatility)
  that are indicative of which simple forecasting model (MA vs. Naive) is momentarily superior.
- >-
  The 'micro-environmental cues' can be reliably and instantly computed from very limited recent data points.
- >-
  The performance difference between simple models is significant enough within their respective 'micro-niches' to warrant
  dynamic switching.
- >-
  The synthetic series has at least two distinct local 'niches' or regimes where one simple model consistently outperforms
  the other.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate various short synthetic time series (e.g., oscillating with varying frequencies/amplitudes, periods of trend/flatness,
  sudden shifts). Implement a 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast. Develop a 'micro-niche adaptation' algorithm
  that continuously calculates simple local cues (e.g., difference between last two points for trend, variance of last three
  for volatility) and uses these to decide whether to use the MA or Naive forecast for the next step. Compare the predictive
  accuracy (e.g., Mean Squared Error) of the micro-niche adaptive approach against the individual MA and Naive forecasts on
  these synthetic series.
success_criteria: >-
  The micro-niche adaptive forecasting approach consistently achieves lower Mean Squared Error (or other relevant error metrics)
  compared to both the standalone 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across a diverse set of short synthetic
  time series designed to exhibit different local 'micro-environmental cues'. Disconfirmation would occur if the adaptive
  approach performs no better, or significantly worse, than the individual simple models.
related_works:
- >-
  Adaptive Ensemble Forecasting: Many adaptive ensemble methods exist, but they typically involve more complex base models
  or learning sophisticated weighting schemes over longer time series. Our hypothesis focuses on a simpler, ecologically-inspired
  dynamic selection among *minimal* forecasting models using *instantly computable local cues* for *very short series*, a
  specific combination not widely explored.
- >-
  Regime-Switching Models: While these models adapt to different data 'regimes', they often require sufficient data to learn
  the parameters of each regime and the switching probabilities. Research (e.g., Elliott, 2004) suggests they struggle with
  small sample sizes. Our 'micro-niche adaptation' circumvents complex parameter learning by reacting to immediate, simple
  local cues, specifically targeting the small data challenge.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by the ecological principle of 'niche partitioning', where different species (here, simple forecasting
  models) coexist and thrive by specializing in distinct 'niches' (specific local data characteristics) within an ecosystem
  (the time series). This conceptual transfer suggests a mechanism for dynamic model selection that is agile and efficient,
  particularly suited for resource-constrained environments like very short time series.
terms:
- term: Micro-Niche Adaptation
  definition: >-
    A dynamic forecasting strategy where simple models are selected on-the-fly based on instantaneous, localized data characteristics
    (micro-environmental cues), allowing each model to operate within its optimal data 'niche'.
- term: Micro-Environmental Cues
  definition: >-
    Simple, instantly computable local statistical properties of a time series (e.g., local trend, recent volatility) that
    serve as indicators for which forecasting model is most appropriate for the immediate next prediction.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes a 'Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting' approach for short time series, dynamically switching between
  simple models like moving average and naive forecasts based on real-time local data cues. Inspired by ecological niche partitioning,
  this method aims to outperform individual simple models by allowing each to specialize in its optimal data 'niche', particularly
  addressing challenges with small sample sizes.

title: Compare Simple Forecast Models
summary: >-
  This artifact evaluates two simple forecasting models, a 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast, on a synthetic
  sine wave time series with added noise. The evaluation uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as primary
  metrics to quantify predictive accuracy. The `eval.py` script generates the synthetic data, calculates predictions for both
  models, and computes the metrics. The output `eval_out.json` adheres to the `exp_eval_sol_out.json` schema, providing aggregate
  metrics and detailed per-example results, including the true values, predictions from each model, and per-step evaluation
  errors. The naive forecast generally exhibited lower MSE and MAE on this specific synthetic series, suggesting its immediate
  adaptation to the last observed value was more effective than the smoothing effect of the 3-point moving average for this
  particular dataset characteristics.

Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  For short synthetic time series, dynamically switching between simple forecasting models (e.g., 3-point moving average,
  naive last-value forecast) based on real-time, instantly computable local 'micro-environmental cues' (such as local trend
  direction or recent volatility) will outperform either model individually, by enabling each model to operate within its
  optimal 'micro-niche' of data characteristics.
motivation: >-
  Traditional forecasting methods, including many adaptive ensembles or regime-switching models, struggle with very short
  time series due to insufficient data for learning complex parameters or stable regime identification. By leveraging an ecological
  'niche partitioning' principle, this hypothesis proposes a lightweight, dynamic selection mechanism for simple models that
  can adapt quickly to local data characteristics, potentially overcoming the limitations of small sample sizes and improving
  predictive performance in data-scarce scenarios.
assumptions:
- >-
  Short synthetic time series exhibit discernible 'micro-environmental cues' (e.g., local trend changes, shifts in volatility)
  that are indicative of which simple forecasting model (MA vs. Naive) is momentarily superior.
- >-
  The 'micro-environmental cues' can be reliably and instantly computed from very limited recent data points.
- >-
  The performance difference between simple models is significant enough within their respective 'micro-niches' to warrant
  dynamic switching.
- >-
  The synthetic series has at least two distinct local 'niches' or regimes where one simple model consistently outperforms
  the other.
investigation_approach: >-
  Generate various short synthetic time series (e.g., oscillating with varying frequencies/amplitudes, periods of trend/flatness,
  sudden shifts). Implement a 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast. Develop a 'micro-niche adaptation' algorithm
  that continuously calculates simple local cues (e.g., difference between last two points for trend, variance of last three
  for volatility) and uses these to decide whether to use the MA or Naive forecast for the next step. Compare the predictive
  accuracy (e.g., Mean Squared Error) of the micro-niche adaptive approach against the individual MA and Naive forecasts on
  these synthetic series.
success_criteria: >-
  The micro-niche adaptive forecasting approach consistently achieves lower Mean Squared Error (or other relevant error metrics)
  compared to both the standalone 3-point moving average and the naive last-value forecast across a diverse set of short synthetic
  time series designed to exhibit different local 'micro-environmental cues'. Disconfirmation would occur if the adaptive
  approach performs no better, or significantly worse, than the individual simple models.
related_works:
- >-
  Adaptive Ensemble Forecasting: Many adaptive ensemble methods exist, but they typically involve more complex base models
  or learning sophisticated weighting schemes over longer time series. Our hypothesis focuses on a simpler, ecologically-inspired
  dynamic selection among *minimal* forecasting models using *instantly computable local cues* for *very short series*, a
  specific combination not widely explored.
- >-
  Regime-Switching Models: While these models adapt to different data 'regimes', they often require sufficient data to learn
  the parameters of each regime and the switching probabilities. Research (e.g., Elliott, 2004) suggests they struggle with
  small sample sizes. Our 'micro-niche adaptation' circumvents complex parameter learning by reacting to immediate, simple
  local cues, specifically targeting the small data challenge.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by the ecological principle of 'niche partitioning', where different species (here, simple forecasting
  models) coexist and thrive by specializing in distinct 'niches' (specific local data characteristics) within an ecosystem
  (the time series). This conceptual transfer suggests a mechanism for dynamic model selection that is agile and efficient,
  particularly suited for resource-constrained environments like very short time series.
terms:
- term: Micro-Niche Adaptation
  definition: >-
    A dynamic forecasting strategy where simple models are selected on-the-fly based on instantaneous, localized data characteristics
    (micro-environmental cues), allowing each model to operate within its optimal data 'niche'.
- term: Micro-Environmental Cues
  definition: >-
    Simple, instantly computable local statistical properties of a time series (e.g., local trend, recent volatility) that
    serve as indicators for which forecasting model is most appropriate for the immediate next prediction.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes a 'Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting' approach for short time series, dynamically switching between
  simple models like moving average and naive forecasts based on real-time local data cues. Inspired by ecological niche partitioning,
  this method aims to outperform individual simple models by allowing each to specialize in its optimal data 'niche', particularly
  addressing challenges with small sample sizes.

title: Compare Simple Forecast Models
summary: >-
  This artifact evaluates two simple forecasting models, a 3-point moving average and a naive last-value forecast, on a synthetic
  sine wave time series with added noise. The evaluation uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as primary
  metrics to quantify predictive accuracy. The `eval.py` script generates the synthetic data, calculates predictions for both
  models, and computes the metrics. The output `eval_out.json` adheres to the `exp_eval_sol_out.json` schema, providing aggregate
  metrics and detailed per-example results, including the true values, predictions from each model, and per-step evaluation
  errors. The naive forecast generally exhibited lower MSE and MAE on this specific synthetic series, suggesting its immediate
  adaptation to the last observed value was more effective than the smoothing effect of the 3-point moving average for this
  particular dataset characteristics.

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right.

Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}
