> **TL;DR** — This paper introduces Micro-Niche Adaptive Forecasting for short time series, dynamically switching between simple models (moving average, naive) based on local data cues. Inspired by ecological niche partitioning, the method significantly outperforms individual baselines, achieving a 48.3% and 66.5% lower MSE than naive and moving average forecasts, respectively. This demonstrates an effective strategy for data-constrained forecasting.

<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

For short synthetic time series, dynamically switching between simple forecasting models (specifically, 3-point moving average and naive last-value forecast) based on real-time, instantly computable local 'micro-environmental cues' (such as local trend direction and recent standard deviation-based volatility) will significantly outperform either model individually, by enabling each model to operate within its optimal 'micro-niche' of data characteristics, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.

## Repository Structure

Artifacts are grouped by the round of invention that produced them. Each
artifact has its own folder with source code and a self-contained demo:

```
